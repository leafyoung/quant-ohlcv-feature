    RSI reflects the ratio of average gains to average losses over a period.
    When RSI > 70, the market is considered to be in a strong uptrend or even overbought;
    when RSI < 30, the market is in a strong downtrend or even oversold.
    When RSI drops below 30 then crosses back above 30, prices are expected to rebound from oversold levels;
    when RSI exceeds 70 then crosses below 70, the market is expected to pull back from overbought levels.
    In practice, the 70/30 threshold is not required. Here we use 60/40 as signal thresholds.
    A buy signal is generated when RSI crosses above 40; a sell signal when RSI crosses below 60.
