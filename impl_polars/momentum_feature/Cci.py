    The CCI indicator measures the deviation of the typical price (mean of high, low, and close) from its moving average over a period.
    CCI can be used to reflect overbought and oversold market conditions.
    Generally, CCI above 100 indicates the market is overbought; CCI below -100 indicates the market is oversold.
    When CCI crosses below 100 / crosses above -100, it suggests the price may begin to reverse, and one may consider selling/buying.
