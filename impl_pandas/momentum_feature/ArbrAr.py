    AR measures where the open price falls between the high and low; BR measures where
    yesterday's close falls between today's high and low. AR is a sentiment indicator
    measuring the balance between bulls and bears. When AR is low (below 50), sentiment is
    very weak; if AR crosses above 50 from below, prices may rise — buy at the low.
    Sell when AR crosses below 200.
