    KDJD can be seen as a variant of KDJ. The variable Stochastics in the KDJ calculation
    measures where the closing price falls between the highest and lowest prices over the
    past N days. The Stochastics_DOUBLE in the KDJD calculation measures where Stochastics
    falls between its maximum and minimum values over the past N days. Here it is used as
    a momentum indicator. Buy/sell signals are generated when D crosses above 70 / below 30.
