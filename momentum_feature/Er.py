    ER is a momentum indicator used to measure the bull/bear power balance in the market.
    In a bull market, people buy more greedily near the high price; the higher the BullPower, the stronger the current bull force.
    In a bear market, people may sell out of fear near the low price; the lower the BearPower, the stronger the current bear force.
    When both are greater than 0, it reflects that bulls currently dominate;
    when both are less than 0, it reflects that bears dominate.
    If BearPower crosses above 0, a buy signal is generated;
    if BullPower crosses below 0, a sell signal is generated.
