    # The KAMA indicator is similar to VIDYA in that it incorporates the ER (Efficiency Ratio) into the moving average weight.
    # Its usage is similar to other moving averages. When the current trend is strong, the ER value is large, and KAMA assigns greater weight to the current price,
    # making KAMA follow price movements closely, reducing its lag; when the current trend is weak (e.g., in an oscillating market), the ER value is small,
    # KAMA assigns less weight to the current price, increasing KAMA's lag, making it smoother and avoiding too many trading signals.
    # Unlike VIDYA, the KAMA indicator can set upper bound FAST and lower bound SLOW for the weight.
